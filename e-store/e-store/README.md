# Apple Clone Front-End

## Overview
This project is a front-end clone of Apple's website, built using React and Material UI. It features a clean design and responsive layout, mimicking the look and feel of Apple's official site.

## Set Up a React Project
1. Begin by creating a new React application using:

> npx create-react-app your-project-name

2. Navigate into the newly created project directory.
3. Start the application with >> npm start


## Project Structure
- Understand that `index.js` is the main entry point of the React app.
- The `App.js` file will serve as a basic landing page; however, you'll make a `pages` folder containing a `Home.js` component.

## Component Creation
- Create a `components` folder inside the `src` folder and add the following:
- `Header.js`: Will contain the navigation bar.
- `Info.js`: Will contain the content below the header.
- `Section.js`: Will contain sections of the page.
- `Products.js`: Will contain product listings.

## Material UI Installation
1. Install Material UI using:
>npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
2. Import the icons as well


## Implement the Header
- Use a Box component from Material UI as a container for the header.
- Include an image for the logo.
- Use an array for other navigation elements and loop through it to generate the items.
- Incorporate icons such as search and shopping bag from Material UI's icon library.
- Employ styled components to apply CSS, including background color, layout, and spacing.

## Implement the Info Section
- Utilize a Box component as a container and Typography for the text.
- Apply styling using styled components for layout, font size, and spacing.

## Implement Sections
1. Create an array of data objects in a constants file, including section headings, sub-headings, and image URLs.
2. Pass the data as props to the section component in `Home.js`.
3. Use a Box component to contain the section and use Typography for the heading and subheading.
4. Also, use a styled component for adding a background image. Add styles for alignment and layout. Include "Learn More" and "Buy" text with a right arrow.

## Implement Products
1. Create a `Product.js` component which is similar to the section.
2. Pass data to this from `Home.js` and render it in a loop.
3. Style the product component to display the data appropriately.

## Styling
- Make use of Material UI components like Box and Typography.
- Use styled components for applying custom styles.
- Use flexbox for layout management, especially for aligning and centering items.

## Navigation
- The navigation items in the header are generated by looping through a data array.
